\section*{Research Statement}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
&

I'm a Computer Science PhD student at UT Austin. My main research interests are health and wellness applications of machine learning, particularly those involving graphical models, Bayesian statistical methods, and scalable inference algorithms. My current projects include obesity and nutrition modeling, wearable devices for fitness tracking, and large-scale multiple hypothesis testing for fMRI and allele frequency studies. I am passionate about taking my research into the real world and am continually looking for new opportunities to collaborate with tech startups wishing to improve the lives of their users.
