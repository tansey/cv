\section*{Research Statement}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
&

I'm a PhD student at UT Austin interested in scaling machine learning techniques to real-world domains. My main research is on algorithms for discovering Nash equilibria in full-scale multiplayer poker. If successful, these techniques may have significant consequences for the next-generation smart energy grid and other reinforcement learning systems.\\\\

&I am passionate about companies and ideas that have the potential to be hugely disruptive. I'm currently looking for summer internships as a data scientist or software engineer at such a company.
