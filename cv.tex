\section*{Research Statement}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
&

I'm a PhD student in the Neural Networks Research Group at UT Austin. My main research interests are machine learning and medical applications, particularly how we can use big data to discover and recommend better treatments for patients with chronic illness. I spend most of my days working on algorithms to create personalized, adaptive treatments from patient health logs. If successful, these techniques may be able to improve the lives of millions of people living with chronic disease, as well as making substantial advances in the field of reinforcement learning.\\\\

&I am passionate about taking my research into the real world and using machine learning to make people healthier and happier. Towards this goal, I am currently collaborating with companies enabling chronic illness patients to track various aspects of their health. I am currently working to integrate a treatment recommendation model into one patient powered research network (PPRN), while simultaneously researching novel hierarchical Bayesian methods for patient time series data.
