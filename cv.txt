 **Personal Statement**
 I am passionate about companies and ideas that have the potential to be hugely disruptive. I’m currently looking for a summer internship as a data scientist or software engineer at such a company.

 I’m a PhD student in the Neural Networks Research Group at UT Austin. My main research interests are machine learning and game theory, particularly how we can use function approximators to scale to games with large state and action spaces. I spend most of my days working on algorithms for discovering Nash equilibria in stochastic, partial-information games like poker. If successful, these techniques may have important consequences for the next-generation smart energy grid and other reinforcement learning systems.
